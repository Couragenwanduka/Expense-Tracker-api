### **Steps to Build the Algorithm**

1. **Check Authorization**
   - Verify that the user is authenticated and has permission to access the requested route.
   - Use middleware to handle authentication and authorization efficiently.

2. **Retrieve User Data**
   - Query the database to fetch all relevant user transaction data.
   - Ensure data includes transaction details like category, amount, date, etc.

3. **Sort and Group Data**
   - Organize the fetched data into categories.
   - Use an object or Map to group transactions by category, summing up amounts for each category.

4. **Identify Significant Spending**
   - Determine the category where the user is spending the most.
   - Create logic to flag excessive spending or categories of interest.
   - Generate a query or prompt asking the user for reasons behind significant spending in flagged categories.

5. **Compare Spending to Yearly Income**
   - Calculate the average spending per category.
   - Compare spending amounts in each category to the userâ€™s yearly income.
   - Highlight categories exceeding a reasonable percentage of income.

6. **Calculate Spending Increase Percentage**
   - Analyze spending patterns over time.
   - Compare the current period's spending to previous periods (e.g., month-over-month or year-over-year).
   - Use the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{\text{Current Spending} - \text{Previous Spending}}{\text{Previous Spending}} \times 100
     \]
   - Include category-wise breakdown of spending increases.

### **Implementation Tips**
- **Data Validation:** Validate inputs to prevent errors or malicious data from causing issues.
- **Database Optimization:** Use optimized queries to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Caching:** If possible, cache grouped data to improve performance for frequent queries.
- **User Feedback:** Provide a summary of insights and recommendations based on the results.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Simulate various data sets to ensure the algorithm handles edge cases gracefully.
